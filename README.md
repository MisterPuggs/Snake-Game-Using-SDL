# Snake Game

this is just a simple snake game i made using SDL

has a start menu with play/quit, and then the actual game.

if snake hits a border, it goes back to menu.

if snake eats the red square (apple) it extends by 1 length.

the snake starts with a length of 5, shown as 5 square segments.

the snake can pass through itself. this would be an easy feature to change however i have not done so.
